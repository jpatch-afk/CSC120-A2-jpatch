What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked for this project was the simple syntax and figuring out where certain methods belong to each class: either computer or resale shop. What didn't work was a lot of the other components, it seemed to repeat a lot with the defintion of methods in multiple places, so I wasn't sure if I needed to delete some definitions or just have repetitions to not break the established code. This makes the code and outcome more complicated than it needs to be. I intend to ask more about the code and resubmit with more debugging and less clunkiness. Furthermore, it was very difficult to fix bugs as there were multiple files with the same method name. Some advice I give is to use all resources to make sure that you understand what is asked of you as well as what pieces of code pertain to what functions and whether similar lines need to be repeated or modified to fit the end result. Also, try naming the methods differently according to different files that they adhere to to prevent any confusion in the debugging stage.
